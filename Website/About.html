                        <p>Wind Labs is an open source company that strives to provide better and more accurate data about air quality in a variety of metrics regardless of where you are. It also provides a variety of metrics that other weather network providers don't provide such as the carbon dioxide levels and oxygen levels to show air quality within indoor and outdoor environments.</p>

                        <h2 class="timeline_point_heading">Why we made it and who it is for</h2>
                        <p>
                            Wind Labsâ€™s main goal is to help mitigate the effects of climate change. To achieve this goal we created the Air Quality 5000, a cheaper alternative to assess the air quality of indoor and outdoor environments The Air Quality 5000 costs less than $80 and it provides all the necessary software to take the data. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Identifying the air quality is also useful to help plan for mitigation strategies for climate change and since it is open source, we can exchange the data with another company or organization that can then use that have resources and can deploy solutions to mitigate climate change. The Air Quality 5000 would be directed towards regular people that want to determine whether or not they have a poor ventilation in their workplace. It would also be directed towards various countries to determine and analyze if they need to implement new standards for air quality at home and at work.

                        <p> In the next hackathon, we would like to improve upon this idea by making a number of improvements such as 3-D mapping, the cost, connectivity, and AI. Firstly, the 3-D mapping would allow countries to precisely determine ideal areas to implement mitigation strategies for climate change. Secondly, we would try and make the hardware a more complete package (customizable, reliable, cheaper). Thirdly, we would try to develop some sort of ai that can use prior data to help predict weather patterns as we don't have satellites and that is too expensive for remote areas and 3rd world countries. Finally, we would build some sort of pairing system between the computer and hardware so that someone without coding knowledge can easily pair with the computer.
